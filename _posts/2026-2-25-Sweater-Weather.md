Hi everyone! Heres the output from my sweater weather code at 62 degrees (my perfered sweater weather). A tip I'd give my past self for this assignment is not to get caught up in the weeds trying to figure it all out by myself. I should have gone back to the slideshow sooner to review how if then statements should be formatted.
