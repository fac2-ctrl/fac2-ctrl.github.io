Hi! Here's My stitch sampler. For my two free stitches I decided to do a chain stitch (in two different stitch lengths) and french knots. I also did an extra daisy in the center for some added pizzazz. 

I've only ever used the traditional version of satin stitch, so the thread saving method gave me some trouble at first. But by the time i finished the W I had gained a new appretiation for it. 

There are a few things 'past me' could have done to make this an easier process. First, I think ironing or steaming or even just leaving the fabric under a book for an hour would have made my life much easier. The wrinkles tended to get in the way. Second, I should have thought through my routes more thoroughly. There were a few moments when I had to cut and re-attach thread that could have been avoided. Lastly, I could have taken more time to carefully trace the printout onto the fabric. There were some areas where my pencil was too light to see and I had to somewhat freehand. 

Overall this project was a good reintoduction to embroidery and has gotten me very exited for what's to come.
