Hi! I'm Felix Crary, a first-year looking to double major in physics and philosophy. I've never program before, but am eager to dive into it. On the other hand, I do have lots of experience with sewing, embroidery, and other fiber arts. I co-lead my highschools fiber arts group, volunteered in elementary school classes teaching knitting, and right now I'm working in the 62 Center's costume shop.
