Hi! I'm Felix Crary, a first-year looking to double major in physics and philosophy. I've never program before, but am eager to dive into it. On the other hand, I do have lots of experience with sewing, embroidery, and other fiber arts. I co-lead my highschools fiber arts group, volunteered in elementary school classes teaching knitting, and right now I'm working in the 62 Center's costume shop. 

I'm hoping to get a lot out of this course. For one, computer science has always been this big scary thing to me. I barely made it through my 4th grade computers class and haven't even tried to do anything more than a keyboard shortcut ever since. I think aproaching CS through textiles will make it a little less scary. Secondly, I want to push my textile art even further. I would call myself an experienced knitter, crocheter, and sewist, but I'm always looking for ways to expand my world a little further.

Something about me is that I'm left handed. It doesn't seem like much but I've had to fight with it a lot learning all my crafts. I've become an expert at mentally flipping videos to learn new techniques. If there're any leftys out there who need assistance I'm always happy to help.
