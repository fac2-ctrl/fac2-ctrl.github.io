Computer science can be a big scary thing. I barely made it through my 4th grade computers class and haven't even tried to do anything more than a keyboard shortcut ever since. I think aproaching computer science through textiles will make it a little less intimidating. I also want to push my textile art further. I would call myself an experienced knitter, crocheter, and sewist, but I'm always looking for ways to expand my world a little further.
